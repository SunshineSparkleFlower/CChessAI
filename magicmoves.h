/**
 *magicmoves.h
 *
 *Header file for magic move bitboard generation.  Include this in any files
 *need this functionality.
 *
 *Usage:
 *You must first initialize the generator with a call to initmagicmoves().
 *Then you can use the following macros for generating move bitboards by
 *giving them a square and an occupancy.  The macro will then "return"
 *the correct move bitboard for that particular square and occupancy. It
 *has been named Rmagic and Bmagic so that it will not conflict with
 *any functions/macros in your chess program called Rmoves/Bmoves. You
 *can macro Bmagic/Rmagic to Bmoves/Rmoves if you wish.  If you want to
 *minimize the size of the bitboards, make MINIMIZE_MAGIC uncommented in this
 *header (more info on this later).  Where you typedef your unsigned 64-bit
 *integer declare __64_BIT_INTEGER_DEFINED__.  If USE_INLINING is uncommented,
 *the macros will be expressed as MMINLINEd functions.  If PERFECT_MAGIC_HASH is
 *uncomment, the move generator will use an additional indrection to make the
 *table sizes smaller : (~50kb+((original size)/sizeof(PERFECT_MAGIC_HASH)).
 *The size listed from here on out are the sizes without PERFECT_MAGIC_HASH.
 *
 *Bmagic(square, occupancy)
 *Rmagic(square, occupancy)
 *
 *Square is an integer that is greater than or equal to zero and less than 64.
 *Occupancy is any unsigned 64-bit integer that describes which squares on
 *the board are occupied.
 *
 *The following macros are identical to Rmagic and Bmagic except that the 
 *occupancy is assumed to already have been "masked".  Look at the following
 *source or read up on the internet about magic bitboard move generation to
 *understand the usage of these macros and what it means by "an occupancy that
 *has already been masked".  Using the following macros when possible might be
 *a tiny bit faster than using Rmagic and Bmagic because it avoids an array
 *access and a 64-bit & operation.
 *
 *BmagicNOMASK(square, occupancy)
 *RmagicNOMASK(square, occupancy)
 *
 *Unsigned 64 bit integers are referenced by this generator as U64.
 *Edit the beginning lines of this header for the defenition of a 64 bit
 *integer if necessary.
 *
 *If MINIMIZE_MAGIC is defined before including this file:
 *The move bitboard generator will use up 841kb of memory.
 *41kb of memory is used for the bishop database and 800kb is used for the rook
 *database.  If you feel the 800kb rook database is too big, then comment it out
 *and use a more traditional move bitboard generator in conjunction with the
 *magic move bitboard generator for bishops.
 *
 *If MINIMIAZE_MAGIC is not defined before including this file:
 *The move bitboard generator will use up 2304kb of memory but might perform a bit
 *faster.
